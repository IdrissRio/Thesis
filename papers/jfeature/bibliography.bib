  title     = {Circular Reference Attributed Grammars - their Evaluation and Applications},
  abstract  = {This paper presents a combination of Reference Attributed Grammars (RAGs) and Circular Attribute Grammars (CAGs). While RAGs allow the direct and easy specification of non-locally dependent information, CAGs allow iterative fixed-point computations to be expressed directly using recursive (circular) equations. We demonstrate how the combined formalism, Circular Reference Attributed Grammars (CRAGs), can take advantage of both these strengths, making it possible to express solutions to many problems in an easy way. We exemplify with the specification and computation of the nullable, first, and follow sets used in parser construction, a problem which is highly recursive and normally programmed by hand using an iterative algorithm. We also present a general demand-driven evaluation algorithm for CRAGs and some optimizations of it. The approach has been implemented and experimental results include computations on a series of grammars including that of Java 1.2. We also revisit some of the classical examples of CAGs and show how their solutions are facilitated by CRAGs.},

  abstract   = {Program analyses detect errors in code, but when code changes frequently as in an IDE, repeated re-analysis from-scratch is unnecessary: It leads to poor performance unless we give up on precision and recall. Incremental program analysis promises to deliver fast feedback without giving up on precision or recall by deriving a new analysis result from the previous one. However, Datalog and other existing frameworks for incremental program analysis are limited in expressive power: They only support the powerset lattice as representation of analysis results, whereas many practically relevant analyses require custom lattices and aggregation over lattice values. To this end, we present a novel algorithm called DRedL that supports incremental maintenance of recursive lattice-value aggregation in Datalog. The key insight of DRedL is to dynamically recognize increasing replacements of old lattice values by new ones, which allows us to avoid the expensive deletion of the old value. We integrate DRedL into the analysis framework IncA and use IncA to realize incremental implementations of strong-update points-to analysis and string analysis for Java. As our performance evaluation demonstrates, both analyses react to code changes within milliseconds.},

The conceptual distance between the concrete syntax meta-programmers use to reason about programs and the notation for abstract syntax manipulation provided by general purpose (meta-) programming languages is too great for many applications. In this paper it is shown how the syntax definition formalism SDF can be employed to fit any meta-programming language with concrete syntax notation for composing and analyzing object programs. As a case study, the addition of concrete syntax to the program transformation language Stratego is presented. The approach is then generalized to arbitrary meta-languages.},

abstract="We have found many programming problems for which neither procedural nor object-oriented programming techniques are sufficient to clearly capture some of the important design decisions the program must implement. This forces the implementation of those design decisions to be scattered throughout the code, resulting in ``tangled'' code that is excessively difficult to develop and maintain. We present an analysis of why certain design decisions have been so difficult to clearly capture in actual code. We call the properties these decisions address aspects, and show that the reason they have been hard to capture is that they cross-cut the system's basic functionality. We present the basis for a new programming technique, called aspect-oriented programming, that makes it possible to clearly express programs involving such aspects, including appropriate isolation, composition and reuse of the aspect code. The discussion is rooted in systems we have built using aspect-oriented programming.",

abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program’s authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the past four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.},

\section{Contribution}
\label{sec:contribution}
In this Thesis, we present two major contributions to the field of programming 
language analysis and software engineering. 
The first significant contribution of this thesis is the formalisation of \textsc{IntraCFG},
a language-agnostic RAG-based framework for constructing control-flow graphs (CFGs) 
on top of the abstract syntax tree (AST). \textsc{IntraCFG}, is a highly flexible
framework that enables the construction of light-weight and precise the control-flow graphs
of a program. To exemplify the applicability of \textsc{IntraCFG}, we instantiate it for the TEAL language.

The second contribution is a Java feature extractor called \textsc{JFeature}.
This tool is designed to assist researchers in selecting the appropriate corpora
for their experiments by extracting relevant features from Java programs. 
\textsc{JFeature} is able to extract a wide range of features, 
including syntactic, e.g., use of keywords, and semantic features, e.g.,
the number of method calls.


\subsection{\textsc{IntraCFG}: A Precise Framework for Source-level Control-flow Analysis}
The field of control-flow graph (CFG) construction has seen significant advancements
in recent years, with various frameworks being proposed to aid in the construction 
of precise intraprocedural CFGs~\cite{smits2020flowspec,10.1016/j.scico.2012.02.002}.
We contributed to the state-of-the-art introducing \textsc{IntraCFG}, a declarative, RAG-based,
and language-independent framework for constructing precise intraprocedural CFGs.

Unlike most other frameworks, which build CFGs on an Intermediate Representation (IR) level,
such as bytecode, \textsc{IntraCFG}'s approach is unique in that it superimposes the CFGs 
on the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This allows for a more accurate client analysis,
as the CFGs are constructed directly on the source code level, rather than an
intermediate representation. Additionally, this approach also enables the construction 
of \textsc{AST-Unrestricted} CFGs, which are CFGs whose shape is not restricted to the AST structure.

\subsubsection*{Design and Implementation}
\textsc{IntraCFG} is written within the \textsc{JastAdd} ecosystem.

The framework provides three interfaces, namely \code{CFGRoot}, \code{CFGNode}, and \code{CFGSupport},
to be implemented by AST nodes. Each interface provides a set of attribute that are used to construct
the CFGs.
